Installation
============

Windows
-------

Download and install the latest Python 3.x for Windows: https://www.python.org/downloads/. 
By default, the Python interpreter will be installed at *C:\\Python3x*.

Open the Windows command prompt on the Python folder. There are two possibilities:

- Run ``cmd`` from the start menu on Windows 7 and cd into the Python directory
- Open the File Explorer, press Shift and Right-Click on the Python directory and select "Open command windows here". 

Install flatlib using ``python -m pip install flatlib``.

If you find the following error **Microsoft Visual C++ 10.0 is required (Unable to find vcvarsall.bat)**, 
you will have to install the Visual C++ 2010 compiler to compile the swiss ephemeris extension. 
Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express can be download for free from http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9709949 (it may 
require the creation of a Windows Developer account).
